This repository demonstrates a common error in Java: the ConcurrentModificationException. The example code attempts to remove elements from an ArrayList while iterating over it using an enhanced for loop. This results in the ConcurrentModificationException because the iterator's internal state is inconsistent with the list's structure after the removal.  The solution demonstrates a safe way to modify the list during iteration using an Iterator.
